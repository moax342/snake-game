# Snake Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, developed as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge, specifically on Days 20 and 21. The Snake game is a timeless arcade classic that tests players' reflexes and strategic thinking as they navigate a snake around the screen, consuming food and growing longer with each meal.

## Description

The Snake Game project aims to recreate the nostalgic experience of playing the iconic Snake game on modern platforms. Players control a snake that continuously moves around the screen, aiming to eat food pellets to grow longer. However, they must avoid colliding with walls or their own body, as doing so will end the game.

## Features

- **Simple Controls**: Control the snake's movement using arrow keys or WASD keys.
- **Food Pellets**: Eat food pellets that appear randomly on the screen to grow the snake longer.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score based on the number of food pellets consumed.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between the snake's head and the walls or its own body, ending the game if a collision occurs.
- **Game Over Screen**: Display a game over screen with the final score when the game ends.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy simple sound effects that enhance the gaming experience.
